An idea shared over dinner has been gaining steam, galvanizing and inspiring individuals across the community; A vision of a common voice for our community, a forum to share music, thoughts, and news with eachother and with the world. Thus the idea of Sooke Community Radio was born, and we now undertake the task to make this shared vision a reality. 

We have submitted an application for a Sooke Community Grant, and are working to build a network of interested individuals from across the Sooke Community to bring their voices and skills together to create a new Community Radio station here in Sooke. Our vision is to start with a small mobile-recording studio and online broadcast, and aspire to grow into an organization that will bring together and a provide a common voice for our diverse community.
